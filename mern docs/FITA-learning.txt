Common notes:
For creating a new project:
create-react-app 

For checking mongodb via command promt:
C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.2\bin>mongo
show dbs 
use database_name
db.table_name.find()
db.table_name.find().pretty()
db.tbl_dummy.insertOne({"name":"dummy entry 1"})

======================================

Softwares:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Nov 30, 2019:
Node - https://nodejs.org/en/
React:
npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app <projectname>
ref link: https://makandracards.com/reactjs-quick/52419-install-reactjs-windows
Mongodb - https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/enterprise
Visual studio - https://code.visualstudio.com/
Github - https://github.com/

node -> event based (php thread based -> max thread based on server -> core i5 8th gen -> 8 threads)
react -> single page application
mongo -> non relational (json format) (relational example -> mysql)
=============================

Server:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Dec 07, 2019:
1. package.json
2. dependency and devdependency
Installing node module(nodemon)
For global: npm install -g nodemon
For dev: npm install --save-dev nodemon
3. semantic versioning
Ex: 12.13.1
Here, 12-> broke change, 13-> functionality/feature changes, 1-> bug / issues fixes
4. app.js -> routes flow
Ex url: http://localhost:3001/student
Flow -> (app.js -> app.use -> router var config) -> (router/student.js) -> based on calling method(get/post) render output will be given as response.
5. Rest Api in server:
    Get
    post
6. CORS

Tasks:
1. signup html
2. login html
3. reset password html
4. deactivate account html
----------

Doubts:
1. How to manage multiple node/react projects on a same server and how they will get started
2. Node: Whether we should use "serve" -> scripts for configuring the additional modules like nodemon or we can use any other name. If we should use serve then how we configure another module.
3. What is the use of private in packages.json
4. Configuring new git doubts(how to remove subdirectory git and make the parent folder as git master, enable/disable git)
5. first coming to app.js or index.js
---------

Dec 08, 2019:
1. Bootstrap
2. Box model, box shadow and font awesome icons
3. React new page configuration
4. Diff b/w normal click and Arrow function click event 

Tasks:
1. Signup react page design
2. Login react page design
==============================
Dec 14, 2019:

For installing bootstrap:
PS C:\Users\manik\mern\sample> npm install bootstrap --save

1. Included bootstrap from internal node module
2. Installed react-router-dom, react-router modules
3. Included BrowserRouter from react-router-dom
4. Created Header and Main components
5. Included Router from react-router-dom
6. Route tag used to where it need to be displayed
7. Link tag used to link the redirection
8. Created two dummy components
9. Passed attribute value from parent dummy component to child dummy1 component
10. Constructor and super functions
11. Different type of issues in constructor and super configuration

Tasks:
1. CSS Transition
2. CSS Transformation

For creating a new project:
create-react-app 

For checking mongodb via command promt:
C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.2\bin>mongo

Required items for every class:
1. React -> Run
2. Node -> Run
3. MongoDB -> Run
4. Postman -> config each collections with corresponding method

Doubts:
1. Why we didn't used parent div element on main(switch) and header(header) file
- we can use any html tas as a parent like header
2. Whether Swith is like navigation scripts?
- Yes, it's like switch case concept, only one case will be executed at a time, if nothing mathched then it will execute default.
3. We should include Header and Main order or we can use any order.
- page content served through main file so it should be below header.
