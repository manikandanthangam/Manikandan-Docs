Softwares:

Nov 30, 2019:
Node - https://nodejs.org/en/
React:
npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app <projectname>

Mongodb - https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/enterprise
Visual studio - https://code.visualstudio.com/
Github - https://github.com/

node -> event based (php thread based -> max thread based on server -> core i5 8th gen -> 8 threads)
react -> single page application
mongo -> non relational (json format) (relational example -> mysql)
=============================

Server:

Dec 07, 2019:
1. package.json
2. dependency and devdependency
Installing node module(nodemon)
For global: npm install -g nodemon
For dev: npm install --save-dev nodemon
3. semantic versioning
Ex: 12.13.1
Here, 12-> broke change, 13-> functionality/feature changes, 1-> bug / issues fixes
4. app.js -> routes flow
Ex url: http://localhost:3001/student
Flow -> (app.js -> app.use -> router var config) -> (router/student.js) -> based on calling method(get/post) render output will be given as response.
5. Rest Api in server:
    Get
    post
6. CORS

Tasks:
1. signup html
2. login html
3. reset password html
4. deactivate account html
----------

Doubts:
1. How to manage multiple node/react projects on a same server and how they will get started
2. Node: Whether we should use "serve" -> scripts for configuring the additional modules like nodemon or we can use any other name. If we should use serve then how we configure another module.
3. What is the use of private in packages.json
4. Configuring new git doubts(how to remove subdirectory git and make the parent folder as git master, enable/disable git)
5. first coming to app.js or index.js
